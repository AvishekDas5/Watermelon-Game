# Watermelon Game

Welcome to the Watermelon Game! This is a modified version of the classic Tetris game where fruits are dropped into a container. Your objective is to strategically position the falling fruits to create combinations and prevent the container from filling up. If a fruit touches the top of the container, it's game over!

## Gameplay

In the Watermelon Game, fruits fall from the top of the screen into a container. You control the fruits using the mouse. Here's how to play:

### Controls

- Use the mouse to navigate the game interface and control the falling fruits.
- Click and drag the fruits horizontally within the container.
- Click anywhere on the screen to drop the currently selected fruit to the bottom of the container.

### Objectives

- Strategically position the falling fruits to create combinations of two or more identical fruits.
- Prevent the container from filling up by clearing rows of fruits.
- Aim to achieve the highest score possible by creating large combinations and clearing multiple rows simultaneously.

### Game Over

The game ends when a fruit touches the top of the container. At this point, your final score is calculated, and you have the option to restart the game and try to beat your previous score.
